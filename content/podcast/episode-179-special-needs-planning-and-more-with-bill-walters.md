  **Gilda Evans:** Hello everyone and welcome. I’m Gilda Evans, bringing you the
  **Autism Resource Podcast**, your one-stop knowledge base for autism and more.
  I am happy to have **Bill Walters** join me today. Bill is a compassionate
  **financial adviser** who helps families navigate complex challenges with
  empathy and strategy, shaped by his own experiences raising a daughter with
  special needs and caring for his mother with dementia. His mission is to guide
  caregivers toward clarity and abundance through **personalized, purpose-driven
  financial and estate planning**. Welcome, Bill, and thank you for joining me
  to discuss your work.


  **Bill Walters:** It’s my pleasure to be on such a great forum and to open my heart to make a difference in the lives I touch.


  **Gilda Evans:** To begin, can you share why it is so important to have a **long-term care game plan**? Tell us a bit about your story.


  **Bill Walters:** My story is a perfect example of what not to do. When my father passed in 2015, his deathbed wish was for me to "take care of mom". I didn't truly understand what that meant until dementia and Alzheimer's kicked in. I had to relearn everything, from installing physical safety features like bed alarms and customized ropes for mobility to managing **medicine distribution** after she accidentally took three days' worth of medication in one morning. I eventually created a "Bible"—a **senior trip portfolio** that tracked everything from her blood pressure and exercise to her mood swings after certain foods. This allowed us to provide doctors with a comprehensive picture of her health, which is a level of detail that can save lives.


  **Gilda Evans:** That covers a lot of ground, and I’m sure many listeners are dealing with similar challenges. Moving into the financial side, you speak often about **tax for retirement**. Why is that so important as we approach the future?


  **Bill Walters:** Most people expect taxes to go up, and in **2026, taxes are set to rise across the board by 8%**. Because of the national deficit, I believe they will continue to rise. If you save in a **tax-free retirement account**—which is different from a Roth—you keep what you earn. When you take distributions, you don't have to send 35% to the government; it’s all yours to spend or distribute to your loved ones. It really is the wave of the future.


  **Gilda Evans:** What are some common pitfalls you observe when talking to people about these plans?


  **Bill Walters:** Many think the **401k** is the end-all-be-all, but it’s often more of an owner’s benefit than an employee’s. If your plan doesn't allow for **in-service distribution**, your money is locked away until you are 59 and a half or leave the company, exposing you to decades of **stock market risk**. Another pitfall is the **529 plan** for college. These lack flexibility; for example, they can't always be used for specialized computer certifications or room and board if your child gets a scholarship. You don’t want to put yourself in "handcuffs" when saving for your child's future.


  **Gilda Evans:** Our audience consists largely of neurodivergent individuals and their caregivers. What are the first things a caregiver should consider regarding **special needs planning**?


  **Bill Walters:** First, you must understand tools like the **ABLE account**, which has asset limits—usually less than $2,000 in most states. Once a child reaches 18, you should look into Social Security and **disability income**, as well as writing to the state for cost-of-living increases. Most importantly, you want a **Special Needs Trust** in place. This allows funds to be used for services the state doesn’t provide, like **OT, PT, or speech therapy**. I also recommend a **Daily Living Plan**—a running tab of the child's favorite foods, social skills, and daily routines. If something happens to you, a new caretaker can jump right in and know exactly how to conduct the day.


  **Gilda Evans:** What is the most important takeaway for our listeners, or something we haven't touched on yet?


  **Bill Walters:** It is vital to have an **open mind and heart for change**, including being open to experimental vitamins or all-natural supplements that may help break down communication barriers. While there is no "magic pill," trying vetted options can be another "bullet in the holster of social wellness".


  **Gilda Evans:** We always want to be careful and do our due diligence, right?


  **Bill Walters:** Totally. I would also say that the biggest gift you can give a caregiver of a neurodivergent child is **time**. Giving a parent four or five hours to eat a meal in peace or catch a movie is invaluable for their **self-care**. Atypical families are often waiting for "the other shoe to drop," which leads them to ignore long-term care. You need a **budget of protection**—a game plan of love so that the state doesn't take control if you don't outlive your child.


  **Gilda Evans:** Well put, Bill. Thank you for sharing your story with us today.


  **Bill Walters:** Thank you. If anyone wants to reach out for a one-on-one conversation, they can call my cell at **267-278-5062** or visit my website, **perfectlyimperfectfamilies.com**, for articles and resources.
