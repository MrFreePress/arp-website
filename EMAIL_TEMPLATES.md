### Email 2: Impact Stories & Testimonials
**Send**: 3 days after Email 1  
**Subject**: Meet the Families You're Helping

```
Hi [First Name],

I wanted to share something special with you today.

Last week, we received this message from Sarah, a mother in California:

"When my son was diagnosed with autism, I felt completely lost. The Autism Resource Project became my lifeline. The podcast helped me understand what my son was experiencing, the resource library gave me practical tools, and the community connections showed me I wasn't alone. Thank you for being there when we needed you most."

This is why we do what we do.

And with partners like [Company Name], we can reach even more families like Sarah's.

Here's What Your Support Makes Possible:

📚 FREE Resource Library
Every month, over 2,000 families download our guides on topics like:
• Navigating IEPs and special education
• Understanding sensory processing
• Finding local support groups
• Employment resources for autistic adults

🎙️ Expert Podcast Interviews
Our podcast reaches 15,000+ listeners monthly, featuring:
• Leading autism researchers
• Experienced therapists and educators
• Neurodivergent advocates
• Parents sharing real experiences

🤝 Community Connections
We've helped 1,500+ families find local support groups and resources in their area.

💰 $250,000+ in Free Services
All of our resources are completely free, removing financial barriers for families who need support.

The Impact Continues to Grow

With corporate sponsorship, we can:
• Expand our podcast to reach more families
• Create new resources on critical topics
• Build technology tools for easier resource access
• Host community events and workshops

I'll share more about specific sponsorship opportunities in my next email, but I wanted you to see the real impact first.

What questions do you have about our work?
